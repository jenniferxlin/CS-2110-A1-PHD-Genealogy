# CS-2110-A1-PHD-Genealogy

In this assignment, we developed a class PHD that will maintain information about the PHD of a person
and a JUnit class PHDTester to maintain a suite of test cases for class PHD. An object of class PHD will contain a
PHD’s name, gender, date of the PHD, the PHD’s known advisors, and the number of known advisees of the PHD.
